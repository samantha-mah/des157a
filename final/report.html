        <h1>Final Project Report</h1>

        <img src="images/gallery.jpg" alt="gallery page">

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
        <p><strong>Improving affordances</strong>: Letting users know that images are clickable by switching the cursor to a pointer and/or adding instructions.</p>

        <p><strong>Simplifying navigation</strong>: Removing the ability to swap overlays; users would prefer to select an image from the gallery page instead of clicking to the next overlay without knowing which one is coming up.</p>

        <p><strong>Decrease cognitive load</strong>: Make each image larger so that there are less in the viewport at a time instead of having all seven visible at once.</p>

        <h3>Tester Profile</h3>
        <p>Both users are college students. User #1 is male, age 18, and interested in photography. User #2 is female, age 21, and has had several years of experience with film photography. Both users tested a prototype designed for desktop.</p>

        <p>When searching for appropriate users, I made sure to find people who had an interest in photography, as that coincides with my target audience.</p>

        <h3>Task List</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Learn more about the significance of Arashiyama</li>
            <li>Navigate to the page about Hiroshima</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <h3>Bugs</h3>
        <p>Not related to code, but there is no way to prototype a hover and click interaction in Figma for the same element. Thus, during user testing, I had to instruct the user to use an alternative trigger: pressing the spacebar in place of clicking.</p>
        <p>If the user scrolls too quickly at the beginning of the camera animation, the switch does not trigger and the overlay remains visible.</p>

        <h3>Usability Problems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>There was no indication that the images on the gallery page were clickable</li>
            <li>Users were not likely to click next to find a specific image, they would prefer to choose from the gallery page</li>
            <li>It would be easier to see the images in the gallery view if each one was larger</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Other Feedback</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Users thought the camera animation triggered by scrolling was cool</li>
            <li>The transition from black to white background was dramatic and helped acclimate the users to where they were within the narrative of the site</li>
            <li>They also really liked the images and how the curation fed into a larger overarching theme</li>
        </ul>
